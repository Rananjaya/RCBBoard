RCBBoard is an independent fork of [HeliBoard](https://github.com/HeliBorg/HeliBoard) by Helium314. It is not an official HeliBoard release and is not endorsed by the original maintainers.

RCBBoard is a personal project by [Rananjaya](https://github.com/Rananjaya), made mainly for my own use and to share with friends and family. Most of the code comes from HeliBoard and the projects it is based on (see [Credits](#credits)); RCBBoard adds its own changes, such as a bundled Sinhala dictionary and the Sinhala (Wijesekara) layout.

## Features

- **Suggestions and spell check** from dictionaries, with next-word predictions that learn from what you type.
- **Emoji search and suggestions**, inline and in a separate search, using the bundled emoji dictionaries.
- **Themes**: styles, colours and a background image; follows the system day/night setting on Android 10+ (and some versions of Android 9) and dynamic colours on Android 12+.
- **Custom layouts**: edit the main keyboard [layouts](layouts.md) (when *use system languages* is turned off) and special layouts such as symbols, numbers and the functional keys.
- **Clipboard history**, one-handed mode, split keyboard and a number pad.
- **Backup and restore** of settings and learned words / history.
- **More dictionaries** can be added: build your own, or get them from the [dictionaries repository](https://codeberg.org/Helium314/aosp-dictionaries#dictionaries) (quality may vary).
- **Glide typing** needs a closed-source library that is **not included in RCBBoard**, because no compatible open-source library exists. Without it, glide typing is unavailable. If you want it, you have to add the library yourself: it can be extracted from GApps packages ("*swypelibs*"), or downloaded [here](https://github.com/erkserkserks/openboard/tree/46fdf2b550035ca69299ce312fa158e7ade36967/app/src/main/jniLibs) (click on the file and then "raw" or the download button).

The [HeliBoard wiki](https://github.com/HeliBorg/HeliBoard/wiki) explains these features in detail, including the [FAQ](https://github.com/HeliBorg/HeliBoard/wiki/FAQ) and [hidden features](https://github.com/HeliBorg/HeliBoard/wiki/9.-Hidden-features).

## English and Sinhala

RCBBoard is set up for **English (US)**, **English (UK)** and **Sinhala**. You can switch between them with the globe key. On first start, RCBBoard picks English (UK) if your phone's language is English (UK), and English (US) otherwise; you can enable more in Languages & Layouts.

| Layout | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| **English (US)** – QWERTY | Suggestions, autocorrection, next-word predictions and emoji suggestions, with US spelling (color, realize). |
| **English (UK)** – QWERTY | The same features with the British English dictionary and spelling (colour, realise). |
| **Sinhala** | Sinhala word suggestions from the bundled Sinhala dictionary, and Sinhala emoji suggestions. |
| **Sinhala (Wijesekara)** | The standard Wijesekara typewriter arrangement, with the same Sinhala suggestions. |
| **Sinhala (Singlish)** – QWERTY | Type Sinhala phonetically with English letters, for example `mama` → මම and `sixhala` → සිංහල, with the same Sinhala suggestions. See the [Singlish key table](docs/singlish.md). |

**Typing in Wijesekara.** Type in Unicode order: the consonant first, then the vowel sign. For example, ක then ා gives කා, and ක then ෙ gives කෙ. Characters that a PC keyboard reaches with AltGr (such as independent vowels and two-part vowel signs) are on long-press. See the [Wijesekara layout notes](docs/sinhala-wijesekara-layout.md) for the full key map and sources.

The Sinhala dictionary and the emoji dictionaries are bundled with their sources and licences documented in [`third_party/`](third_party/) and [`licenses/`](licenses/).

## Privacy and security

- **No internet permission.** RCBBoard does not have Android's `INTERNET` permission, so it cannot directly transmit what you type over a network.
- **Your data stays on your device.** Learned words, clipboard history, dictionaries and settings are stored locally. They leave the device only in a backup you export yourself, or in Android's own device backup if you have that turned on.
- **Few permissions.** Besides vibration, the system user dictionary and being notified when the device starts, RCBBoard only asks for contacts access if you turn on contact-name suggestions.
- **Found a security problem?** Please report it privately, as described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Download and install

1. Download an APK from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Rananjaya/RCBBoard/releases).
2. Install it, then enable **RCBBoard** in Android's keyboard settings (usually *Settings → System → Keyboard → On-screen keyboard*) and select it as your keyboard.

RCBBoard needs Android 5.0 or newer. Release APKs are signed with this certificate; you can check it with `apksigner verify --print-certs` ("certificate SHA-256 digest"):

> [!NOTE]
> The F-Droid, GitHub release and IzzyOnDroid listings for HeliBoard install the original project, package `helium314.keyboard`. They do not install RCBBoard (`com.rananjaya.rcbboard`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Upgrading from RCBBoard 4.10.2 or older:** those versions used the package name `com.ranger.myheliboard`. Newer versions use `com.rananjaya.rcbboard`, which Android treats as a **different app**: it does not update the old one, installs next to it, and starts without your settings or learned words. To move your data: in the old app, open *Settings → Advanced → Backup and restore* and save a backup; install the new version, enable it as your keyboard and restore that backup there; then uninstall the old app.

**Build from source:** `./gradlew assembleRelease` builds an unsigned release APK (JDK 17 or newer; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#getting-started)). Source code: https://github.com/Rananjaya/RCBBoard/tree/develop

## Customisation resources

Themes, layouts and dictionaries made for HeliBoard usually work in RCBBoard too. The resources below belong to the **upstream HeliBoard community** and other independent projects. They are **not RCBBoard support channels**; please report RCBBoard problems in this repository instead (see [Contributing](#contributing)).

- **Themes** can be saved and loaded from the menu in the *adjust colours* screen. Collections: [Star-Trowa/heliboard-themes](https://github.com/Star-Trowa/heliboard-themes) and [PickleHik3/droid-tings](https://github.com/PickleHik3/droid-tings); custom colours are shared in [HeliBoard's discussions](https://github.com/HeliBorg/HeliBoard/discussions/categories/custom-colors).
- **Layouts** are text files you can edit, copy and share (see [layouts.md](layouts.md)). Custom layouts are shared in [HeliBoard's discussions](https://github.com/HeliBorg/HeliBoard/discussions/categories/custom-layout).
- **Dictionaries** are built from a wordlist in [this format](https://codeberg.org/Helium314/aosp-dictionaries/src/branch/main/wordlists/sample.combined) (see [wordlist information](https://codeberg.org/Helium314/aosp-dictionaries#wordlist-information)), compiled with [external tools](https://github.com/remi0s/aosp-dictionary-tools), and can be shared or added to the [dictionaries repository](https://codeberg.org/Helium314/aosp-dictionaries/). A wordlist can also be loaded directly in the app.
- **HeliBoard community:** [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/HeliBorg/HeliBoard/discussions), [Lemmy](https://lemmy.world/c/Heliboard) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeliBoard), where these resources are shared.

Other related projects: [k3lp](https://codeberg.org/k3lp/k3lp), a WIP library for keyboard layout parsing (created by [FlorisBoard](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard/) maintainers), and [swipe-o-scope](https://codeberg.org/eclexic/swipe-o-scope) for visualising gesture data.

## Contributing

RCBBoard is a personal project: contributions are welcome, but there is no guarantee that a report will be answered or a pull request accepted.

- **Problems and ideas:** use the RCBBoard repository and its issue templates. Search existing issues first, keep one topic per issue, and see this [guide to effective bug reporting](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html). Problems with the original HeliBoard app belong in [its own tracker](https://github.com/HeliBorg/HeliBoard/issues).
- **Security problems:** never in public issues; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **Code:** see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [AI_USAGE.md](AI_USAGE.md) and the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Pull requests go to `Rananjaya/RCBBoard`, branch `develop`, never to HeliBoard. GitHub may preselect `HeliBorg/HeliBoard` and `main` because RCBBoard is a fork, so please check the base before creating a pull request (see [Where pull requests go](CONTRIBUTING.md#where-pull-requests-go)).
- **Translations:** inherited translations come from HeliBoard, so please improve them on [HeliBoard's Weblate](https://translate.codeberg.org/projects/heliboard/). Translations of RCBBoard-specific strings are welcome in pull requests.
